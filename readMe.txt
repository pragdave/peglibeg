	Ints work, comparisons work, expressions work with ints, as long as 
	parans are not around the whole thing, variablereference half works
	with variables, but not functions, and with math only works when it
	is last in the equation
		- Fix Equations with Parans
		- Fix Equations with variables not last
		- Fix assignment in general
